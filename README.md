# News
A news app developed with Flutter. This app serves as a one-stop destination for users to stay informed with the latest news articles sourced from reputable sources.

Features:

API Integration: Leveraged API integration to fetch news articles from a diverse range of sources, ensuring users have access to accurate and timely information.

Pagination: Implemented pagination to efficiently load and display large volumes of news content, providing a seamless browsing experience for users.

Search Functionality: Integrated a powerful search feature, allowing users to quickly find articles based on keywords or topics of interest.

RESTful API Handling: Effectively managed RESTful API requests and responses to retrieve and display news content seamlessly within the app.

Localization: I also implemented localization to support both Arabic and English languages, providing users with a seamless experience in their preferred language.

Technologies Used:

In addition to Flutter, I utilized a range of technologies and libraries including Provider for state management and cached_network_image for efficient image loading.
